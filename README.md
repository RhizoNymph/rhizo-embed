# rhizo-embed

This is a rhizomatic tool for searching for, storing, and embedding sources of all kinds within the Rhizome.

It is intended as a tool to be used within a larger project and thus has a Flask api to hit with a web app, but it also contains a gradio app for standalone use and debugging purposes.

Right now it supports searching for author information on Google Scholar and for publications on GS or on Arxiv. I will add, um, everything I possibly can.

Package management done with rye.
